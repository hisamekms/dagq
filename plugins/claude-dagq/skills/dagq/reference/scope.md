# Paths and light verification

`integrate` runs a task's `--verify` commands once, serially, after its rebase, so a long check holds every landing behind it. Register a task with the checks its kind of change needs, and declare with `--paths` what it may change so the runtime catches a run that changed more (ADR-0029).

## Globs

`--paths GLOB` (repeatable) is matched against the whole path from the repository root. `*` and `?` stay inside one directory; a segment that is exactly `**` spans any depth. `*.md` is Markdown at the root only, `docs/**` everything under `docs/`, `**/*.md` Markdown anywhere. Blank, absolute (`/...`) and `.` / `..` / empty segments are refused. Without `--paths` a run may change anything.

## Recommended combinations

Follow the repository instructions first; for this repository:

| Change | `--kind` | `--paths` | `--verify` | `--evidence` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docs only (ADRs included) | `docs` | `'docs/**'`, `'*.md'` | `'cargo fmt --all --check'` (or none) | none |
| Plugin docs and skills | `plugin` | `'plugins/**'`, `'docs/**'`, `'*.md'` | `'cargo test --locked --test plugin'` (`tests/plugin.rs` checks the skills) | none |
| Runtime (`src/`, `tests/`, `migrations/`) | `runtime` | none | fmt, clippy, `cargo llvm-cov nextest --locked --fail-under-lines 80` (it runs every test, so no separate `cargo test`) | `e2e` |
| Scripts and CI | `ci` | as the repository says | as the repository says | none |

A task that mixes kinds takes the verification and the `--kind` of the heaviest kind. `--kind` decides no check; it records what the task changes so `show`, `list` and `stats` (`kinds`: runs and median times per kind) need not guess from the title. Change it with `edit TASK --kind KIND` while the task is `draft` or `submitted`. A task without one (every task registered before the kind existed) shows `kind: null`.

The `--verify` commands are integrate's gate, not the worker's checklist: the worker prompt shows them as what integrate runs once after its rebase and tells the session to run the checks the repository's instructions ask of a worker (the `--verify` commands only when the instructions name none). In this repository a worker runs fmt, clippy, `cargo test` for only the tests related to its change (`cargo test --locked --test it <file>::`, e.g. `--test it runtime_claim::` for `tests/it/runtime_claim.rs`, since the integration tests other than e2e and plugin are modules of one test binary `it` (ADR-0078); `cargo test --locked --lib <module>`: the unit tests of the changed module, the feature's `tests/it/*.rs`, and the test files that use a changed `tests/common` or `tests/it/runtime_support` helper) and the task's `--verify` commands other than the coverage gate (`cargo llvm-cov nextest`, or `cargo llvm-cov` in tasks registered before ADR-0076, which stay valid) and a whole `cargo test --locked`, and writes the range it ran into the receipt's `tests` evidence. It never runs the whole `cargo test --locked`: integrate's verification runs every test once after its rebase (`cargo llvm-cov nextest` for a runtime task) (a run resumed because integrate's verification failed may rerun the failing command to reproduce it). A runtime run still runs e2e itself and writes it into the receipt's `e2e`. Decided by a person with the planner on 2026-09-26 (task 528): the worker's whole `cargo test` repeated the tests llvm-cov runs, and the extra test binaries made build and link heavy (ADR-0078 later put the integration tests in one binary), raising host load and the worker's work time (median 1439 s).

## Name the files a runtime task mainly touches

A runtime task (`src/`, `tests/`, `migrations/`) registers no `--paths`, so without help nothing says which files it will change. Write them in its `--description`, e.g. "mainly touches `src/application/supervise/plan_review.rs` and `tests/it/plan_review.rs`". Two readers use them:

- plan review, to find tasks that touch the same files, especially the stats' conflict hotspots, and add the dependency that keeps them from running side by side;
- `related`, whose clues include file names in a task's text (ADR-0063 decision 4), so `related` ranks the right completed tasks higher, and their landed files are what ADR-0069 forecasts this task will touch.

The list is a forecast, not a limit: the worker may change other files as the work needs, and nothing checks the list (`lint` does not require it). Do not write it as `--paths` instead: `--paths` declares what a run may change, and a path outside it parks the run (`scope_violation`, ADR-0029); the repository gives runtime tasks no `--paths`; and ADR-0069 forecasts from declared `--paths` instead of `related` when a task has them, so a wide glob matches more hot files and the supervisor defers claiming the task more often.

## What happens outside the paths

- Validation compares the receipt's commit with where the branch forked from the current `main` (`git merge-base`; the base commit unless a resumed session rebased), so paths other tasks landed are never counted. A changed path no glob matches parks the run as `needs_session` with a `scope_violation` event (`paths`, `allowed`, `reason`); the supervisor resumes the session to restore those paths to their state at `git merge-base HEAD <main>`.
- `integrate` checks the diff it would squash onto `main` after its rebase the same way. Outside paths defer the run (`integration_deferred` with `scope_violation`) without moving `main` or running the verification.
- If the task truly needs another path, the session writes a `failed` receipt naming it. Register the task again with wider `--paths` and the verification that path needs.

## Change the paths

```sh
"$DAGQ" set-paths TASK --paths 'docs/**' --paths '*.md'   # replace every glob of a draft or ready task
"$DAGQ" set-paths TASK --none                             # remove the limit
```

Like `set-goal`, only a `draft` or `ready` task can change; a claimed run is checked against the paths it started with. A change records `task_paths_changed` (`from`, `to`).
