# SessionStart hook (matcher compact|clear) of the claude-dagq plugin.
#
# Only the inbox `dagq up` opens and the planners `dagq plan` or the
# supervisor opens are affected: DAGQ_ROLE (inbox or planner, which they
# put in the workspace's environment with --env) selects `dagq status --role <role>` (supervisors, unfinished runs,
# the attention and asks addressed to that role, and the next cursor) on
# stdout, which Claude Code adds to the context, so the session re-orients
# itself after compaction or /clear. The status comes after one line of text
# naming the role and its skill, and pointing at the status's `language`
# (ADR-t616-2), whose `instruction` names the language to write for people
# in when one is set: Claude Code reads a stdout that is JSON as
# the hook's control output and drops its unknown keys, so the bare status
# would never reach the context. Every other session, workers included,
# gets no output. The hook never fails the session start: when status cannot
# be read it prints one line saying why and exits 0. startup is left to each
# session's initial prompt.
