//! `up` and `down`: the cold start and the stop of one queue's runtime. `up`
//! makes sure a supervisor is resident (as a launchd LaunchAgent, restarted
//! after any exit) and that the inbox's Claude session has a cmux
//! workspace, and reports the queue's open work. Planners are not resident:
//! a person opens one with `dagq plan` ([`super::planner`], ADR-0041
//! decision 6). `down` unloads the agent so the
//! supervisor drains and is not restarted. Both are idempotent: a second
//! `up` reuses what the first one started.
//!
//! A launchd-started supervisor is not a child of a cmux terminal, and cmux
//! admits such a process only by socket password. `up` therefore proves the
//! connection from outside cmux (a `ping` with the agent's environment, run
//! outside cmux's process tree) before it writes the agent, or launchd would
//! keep restarting a supervisor that fails its own preflight forever. Where
//! that password is not configured, `up --in-cmux` starts the supervisor
//! inside the cmux workspace `[<repo>]supervisor` instead, with no
//! launchd involved and so nothing to restart it (ADR-0011).
//!
//! A supervisor is only reused while it runs this binary's own build.
//! Every registration carries the `binary_version` its process recorded,
//! and `up` hands a live supervisor of any other build over to this binary
//! without waiting for its sessions (the supervisor execs it under its own
//! pid and token), or drains one that cannot take a handoff before
//! starting one of its own in its place (ADR-0045 decisions 10, 15).
//!
//! The use cases reach the queue, cmux, launchd, processes, Claude Code and
//! the files through [`Ports`]; the entry points in [`crate::compose`]
//! build the adapters.
