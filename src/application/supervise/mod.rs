//! The supervisor (ADR-0024 decision 1): execute claimed tasks in parallel,
//! validate their receipts, review accepted runs headless, land them on
//! main one at a time, triage failed ones and resume parked ones. One run's
//! state machine is unchanged from the single-run supervisor; the loop
//! multiplexes independent slots and isolates failures. A run whose
//! supervisor died while its session lives on is adopted by a supervisor
//! with a free slot instead of being rerun (ADR-0012).
//!
//! Everything outside the process reaches the loop through ports: the
//! queue ([`Queue`], a connection per thread from [`QueueOpener`]), Git
//! ([`Repository`], [`MainRemote`]), the verification commands
//! ([`Verifier`]), cmux ([`WorkspaceBackend`]), the agent
//! ([`AgentProvider`]) and what it shows and writes ([`AgentSignals`]),
//! the processes it starts ([`Spawner`]) and checks ([`ProcessControl`]),
//! the run files ([`RunFiles`]) and the time and IDs ([`Generators`]).
//! Progress and diagnostics are `tracing` events with `run_id` /
//! `task_id` / `ask_id` / `error` fields; the entry point picks their
//! subscriber (ADR-0033).
//!
//! This module holds the loop and the state machine of a slot (`Phase`,
//! `step`); each phase's watch and the supervisor's methods for it are in
//! the submodules: `session` (the worker's session), `exit` (its `/exit`),
//! `jobs` (the headless review and triage), `landing` (the review verdict
//! and the landing), `revise`, `resume`, `triage`, `adopt` and `idle` (the
//! idle marker). The prompts and requests are in [`super::prompt`].
