//! ([`DiskConfig::needs`]). Short of either, it cleans what the ended runs
//! left ([`Supervisor::clean_ended_worktrees`] and `git worktree prune`,
//! off the loop: task 405) and reads again once that is done, recording
//! `auto_repaired` (`repair: disk_cleanup`) when it freed something; the

//! the queue's one `cost` ask about the disk (`subject: disk`) once, and
//! the runs whose landing waits for the disk join it. The claims are held through
//! [`Supervisor::hold_claims`] (`claim_held`, reason `disk_space`), the
//! landings through `landing_held` / `landing_resumed`; a run waiting to
//! land stays awaiting integration and starts no verification.
