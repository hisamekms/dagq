//! The recovery job of a live session's alert (ADR-0047 decisions 39 and
//! 40): background work past `[stall].background_alert_secs`
//! (`long_background`), processes of the run that stay alive without
//! using CPU time (`idle_process`, task 469), a session that holds the
//! supervisor's `/exit` back after the runtime's own repairs
//! (`stuck_exit`), and a dialog the runtime does not answer by itself
//! (`prompt_waiting`). The supervisor records
//! `recovery_requested` and starts a headless job with the screen, the
//! run's processes and the worktree's state; the job only reads and prints
//! a verdict. The runtime checks every action's preconditions again, and
//! applies a `repair` of high confidence only when all of them hold,
//! recording `auto_repaired` (`layer: recovery`) for each and
//! `recovery_finished`. A verdict it does not apply, one of low confidence,
//! an escalation, a failed job and an alert past [`MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS`]
//! become the alert's ask to the inbox (`stalled`, `stuck_exit`,
//! `answer_prompt`), with the job's diagnosis, its actions as the
//! recommendation, its options added and its reason category. A run that
//! ended (`failed`, `interrupted`, `resume_exhausted`) is recovered in
//! `triage.rs`, with the same verdict.
