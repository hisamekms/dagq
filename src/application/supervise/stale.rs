//! A session idle with a receipt for an older commit (task 357): the
//! session committed again (or rebased) after writing its receipt and went
//! idle without rewriting it. When the worktree HEAD is a clean new commit
//! on top of the run's base, the supervisor types one fixed request to
//! rewrite the receipt ([`stale_receipt_nudge`]) before it goes on; if the
//! session answers without rewriting it, the run goes on as before.
//!
//! Each phase (the first session, and each resume attempt) gets at most one
//! request, recorded as `stale_receipt_nudged` before it is typed, and how it
//! ended as `stale_receipt_resolved` (`rewritten`, `unchanged`,
//! `run_ended`, or `unsent` when it could not be typed).
