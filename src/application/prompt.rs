         Follow the dagq-planner skill of the dagq plugin. Read the repository's AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md) for its rules on verification, paths, evidence and ADR numbers. Look for tasks that already cover the draft or code that already does it (`dagq search '<words>'`, `dagq show ID`, the source) before you decide. Then do exactly one of these three:\n\
         1. Adopt: complete the draft with `dagq edit {id}` (acceptance, `--verify`, `--paths`, `--evidence`, and `--context` beginning with `{context_head}`), add its dependencies with `dagq dependency add`, check it with `dagq lint {id}` and submit it with `dagq submit {id}`. Plan review checks it before it becomes ready.\n\
         2. Drop: when it is already done, duplicated or not worth doing, cancel it with `dagq cancel {id}` and record why with `dagq note --task {id} --text '<why>'`. When another task already covers it (a duplicate, or a completed task that already did it), cancel it with `dagq cancel {id} --duplicate-of <that task>` instead, so the queue records which task it duplicates.\n\
         3. Ask: when you cannot decide without a person (the plan's intent, its scope, whether it belongs to this goal or a new one), run `dagq ask --task {id} --kind planner_question --because scope --question '<everything the person needs, with your recommendation>' --option adopt --option cancel --option keep_draft`, report briefly and stop. The answer arrives in this terminal as `answer to ask <id>: ...`: on adopt do 1, on cancel do 2 (the note names the ask), on keep_draft leave the draft as it is and stop.\n\
         The runtime refuses your submit of a follow_up draft whose goal is closed or that is two follow-ups from a person's judgement unless a person answered adopt: ask then.\n\
         When you are done, report the outcome in one or two sentences and stop; the runtime ends this session. Do not work on anything but this draft. Never open the queue database directly; use the dagq CLI only.\n",

         First read the repository's own rules in {repo}: AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md, docs/adr/README.md (the ADR index) and the ADRs and design documents the tasks name. \
         Apply what they say (the verification each kind of change needs, the declared paths, how ADR numbers are assigned, ...); the runtime has no such rules of its own.\n\n\
         The proposal was submitted {submitted} and was sent back {revises} time(s) before (at most {max}; a revise past that goes to a person as a concern).\n\n\
         Tasks of the proposal:\n{tasks}\n\n\
         Files each task of the proposal is expected to touch (its declared paths; without them, the files the landings of its 3 most related completed tasks changed; a guess, so check it against the source):\n{own_expected}\n\n\
         Goals they belong to (description, acceptance, constraints; constraints win over a task's description):\n{goals}\n\n\
         The mechanical checks (`dagq lint`) found:\n{lint}\n\n\
         Other proposals not ready yet:\n{others}\n\n\
         Ready and in-progress tasks, in summary, newest first (expected_files as for the proposal's tasks, and for an in-progress task also what its run changed so far; full_text_below marks a task given in full below):\n{queued}\n\n\
         In full, the ready and in-progress tasks among the candidates below or expected to touch a hotspot a task of the proposal is expected to touch:\n{queued_full}\n\n\
         Asks a person answered before (newest first):\n{precedents}\n\n\
         Files the landings conflicted in most lately (`dagq stats` conflict_hotspots: conflicts, tasks, landings on main that changed the file, their ratio; alert when over the thresholds), each with the tasks of the proposal (proposal_tasks) and the ready and in-progress tasks (queued_tasks) expected to touch it:\n{hotspots}\n\n\
         Candidates of duplicates and of changes already made, one line per task of the proposal (related: the tasks `dagq related` ranks highest, in any status, with the clues that relate them; search: the tasks and landed commits `dagq search` finds for the words of the task's title, with their status; at most {most} of each, none of the proposal's own tasks; an empty list means none was found):\n{candidates}\n\n\
         Check the meaning of the plan:\n\
         - a task that repeats another task (ready, in progress, in another proposal, or already landed on main); start from its candidates above, a completed or canceled one included, and judge from their titles, clues and the source whether the task really repeats one;\n\
         - a task whose change is already on main (read the source; a completed candidate or a landed commit is where to look);\n\
         - a contradiction with an ADR or with the goal's constraints;\n\
         - an acceptance criterion that contradicts the task's own description or a sibling task's acceptance (for example a change of a type whose acceptance says a test file that uses the type is not changed);\n\
         - tasks that change the same files without a dependency between them, above all a file listed as conflicting often: for each hotspot whose proposal_tasks and queued_tasks are both non-empty, add a dependency (add_dependency, the task of the proposal waiting for the queued one) or say in summary why none is needed; you may read the source to see which files a task of the proposal really touches;\n\
         - a task that partly repeats a ready or in-progress task (the overlap goes once the scope of one is cut): not pass but revise, saying in the reason which part to cut and which of the two keeps it;\n\
         - a contradiction with another proposal: with one submitted before this one, send this one back; with one submitted after, pass this one (the later one is checked against it);\n\
         - a ready task that has to change for this proposal to hold: name it in reopen, and the runtime takes it out of the claim for a planner to fix; an in-progress task is never changed: send this proposal back asking for a task that fixes it after it lands and depends on it;\n\
         - every finding of `dagq lint` is one to fix.\n\n\
         Decide one verdict:\n\
         - pass: the tasks may run as written, after the actions below.\n\
         - revise: findings the planner can fix without a person's judgment (wording, acceptance, verification, paths, a split, a scope that partly overlaps another task, a missing task or dependency). Each reason says what to change.\n\
         - concern: findings that need a person's judgment: a doubtful duplicate, a change that looks already done, a contradiction with an ADR or the goal's constraints, a change of the plan's intent.\n\
         When a finding is of the same kind as an answered ask above, put that ask's id in precedents and say in the reason how the person answered then.\n\n\
         actions are the only changes you make yourself, and only with pass: add_dependency (a task of the proposal waits for another task), lower_priority (never raise one), cancel_duplicate (only an obvious duplicate; a doubtful one, or a change that looks already made, is a concern). Everything else is the planner's.\n\n\
         Whatever the verdict, also estimate the weight of each submitted task of the proposal (tasks {predicted}), one entry per task in predictions, from what you read: \
         a worker (one Claude Opus session in its own Git worktree) implements the task, runs fmt, clippy and the tests of the change (e2e when the runtime changes), commits and writes a receipt; \
         then a headless review (pass / revise / concern) and `integrate`'s verification after the rebase onto main follow, and a failure, a conflict or missing evidence resumes the run. \
         size is S, M or L; nature is mechanical, implementation, design_judgment or investigation; uncertainty is 0 to 1 (1 the least certain); \
         expected_output_tokens is the output tokens (thinking included) of one worker run: a small one about 5000, a large one about 250000, the median about 35000; \
         rework_probability is 0 to 1, the chance the run is resumed or review answers revise or concern; reason is one sentence. The estimate is recorded only and changes nothing of the verdict.\n\n\
