//! `dagq install`: a person's way to replace the fixed binary and the
//! queue's supervisor with it, without waiting for the sessions (ADR-0045
//! decisions 11–14). The new binary is built (or given), checked, the
//! queue's compatible migrations applied with it, and put in place of the
//! old one by a rename that keeps the old one as `<name>.previous`; then
//! every live supervisor that takes a handoff is asked to exec it. The old
//! binary goes back only when none of them took it; when some did, it stays
//! and the ones that did not are named in a [`KeptBinary`] error
//! (ADR-t632-1). A build
//! whose migrations would break the old binary goes through the drain
//! instead, and only when asked to. `--rollback` does the same with
//! `<name>.previous`.
//!
//! The binaries are built, run and moved through [`Binaries`], the queue
//! is read through [`QueueOpener`]; [`crate::compose`] builds the adapters.
