//! A planner session (ADR-0041 decisions 1, 6, 12, 13): an on-demand cmux
//! workspace where a planner writes goals and tasks and submits them as a
//! proposal. A person opens one with `dagq plan`, the runtime opens one for
//! a proposal it sends back or a follow_up draft. Each is recorded apart
//! (`planners`), with the pids and heartbeat of its session wrapper, so its
//! liveness and idleness are judged the way a worker's are.
