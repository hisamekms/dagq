//! Deferring the claim of one task (ADR-0069): a candidate whose expected
//! files meet those of a run in flight on a file the landings keep
//! conflicting in (a hotspot of `stats`' `conflict_hotspots`) is passed
//! over in that pass, and the next candidate is claimed instead. Where
//! [`super::claim_hold`] holds every claim for the queue, this defers one
//! task; the two share the way they are recorded and shown: a task event
//! when the deferral starts (`claim_deferred`) and one when it ends
//! (`claim_deferral_ended`), which `status` and `stats` read.
//!
//! A task of interrupt priority is never deferred, and a deferral ends
//! once it has lasted `[conflicts] defer_max_secs`: the task is claimed
//! then even if the files still meet.
