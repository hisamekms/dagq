# Check that no test file under tests/ (every .rs file at any depth:
# tests/*.rs, tests/common/*.rs, tests/it/*.rs and tests/it/runtime_support/*.rs)
# has more than 3,000 lines, so the files split by feature do not grow back
# into one file that every runtime task appends to and conflicts in. The
# integration tests share one test binary (tests/it, ADR-0078), but the limit
# stays per file. The integration tests of the broker's crates
# (crates/*/tests, ADR-t827-1) are held to the same limit. src/ is not
# checked yet.
#
# Meant to be run from the repository root (`sh scripts/check-test-file-lines.sh`).
# When run from anywhere else it changes to the repository root found from the
# script's own location, so the result does not depend on the cwd.
#
# Exit 0 when every file is within the limit, 1 when a file is over it (each
# offending file and its line count go to stderr), 2 when tests/ is not found.
